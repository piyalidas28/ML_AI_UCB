This project explores a dataset containing details on over 426,000 used cars with the goal of identifying factors that significantly impact car prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict car prices based on key features such as mileage, year, and brand.

## CRISP-DM Framework 
Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, this analysis aims to equip used car dealerships with data-driven insights to optimize their inventories based on consumer preferences and market trends.

## Project Results
The goal was to identify factors that affect the price of used cars to help a used car dealership optimize inventory.

Our analysis revealed several key factors that influence used car prices:

* Newer, low-mileage vehicles command higher prices.
* Brand and model impact resalte value.
* Vehicle condition directly affects pricing.

## Key Recommendations
* Priotize newer, low-mileage, high-value brands.
* Dynamically price based on age, mileage and brand.
* Maintain optimal vehicle condition.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the used car market, assisting dealers in making informed decisions to optimize their inventory and improve profitability. The analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in a competitive market.
